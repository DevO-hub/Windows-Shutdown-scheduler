This is my first python application

To access the application click on source > dist > shutdown_scheduler

The application main function is straightforward enter the time you want your pc to shutdown (Time) + (AM PM) once you're done click on schedule shutdown button.

thats it, I hope you enjoy it and feel free to build on it.
